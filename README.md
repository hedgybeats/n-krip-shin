# N-KRIPT

N_KRIPT is a simple desktop application that allows you to encrypt and decrypt files.

With N_KPRIPT , you can protect your sensitive data from prying eyes, whether you're moving it through cloud services or just storing it on your computer.>


### How it works:

When you encrypt a file, N_KRIPT generates an encryption key and an initialization vector (IV) and gives them to you.
**You MUST copy these values and store them somewhere safe, because you'll need them to decrypt the file later!**

N_KRIPT uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to encrypt your files, which is a widely-used and trusted encryption standard.
